//calendars: pick a calendar, and the it chooses which color palette to go with. Color palettes are arrays of color swatch images. You can only pick one calendar

//calendar function: ibaction function. when you pick a calendar, it segues back to the addition screen. The function calculates how long each color shade should be displayed for. total time (from current time to due date)(this will also have to be stored in coredata for later use) divided by how many shades there are in the palette (this interval length of how long each shade should be displayed for will also have to be stored). It starts out on the lightest shade.
///there will be a secondary function, maybe in viewdidload? something that runs every time the homescreen view is brought up. it reruns the calculation, taking the total time and checking where we are at this point in time along the timeline (ie, are we 1/5 of the way to the due date, 2/3 etc). it checks this progress against the interval time and sees if it needs to change the displayed shade. if it does need to change, it does so.
